Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Accounts using AI to generate answers will be banned. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed.

As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day.

Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.\n\n#Rule 4: No medical advice questions\n\nNo medical advice questions\n\nA rule of thumb would be: Could this question or its answers make someone decide not to go see a doctor when they really should?\n\nIf you are asking here to avoid bothering a doctor, you probably should bother a doctor.\n\n#Rule 5: No trolling or joke questions\n\nDisallowed: questions that are joke or trolling questions, memes, just song lyrics as title, etc. \n\n#Rule 6: No suicide or 'was I raped/sexual assaulted/sexually harrassed?' questions\n\nSuicide related questions are best handled by the resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.\n\n#Rule 7: No self-promotion, shilling or begging\n\nNo trying to draw traffic to product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question. \n\nAsking for upvotes, birthday wishes, handouts, or fundraising support fall under this as well. Please see more appropriate subreddits for that. \n\nNo questions trying to elicit participation without learning anything of substance from the answers.\n\n#Rule 8: No illegal/unethical or disturbing subject matter\n\nNothing like \"Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?\" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.\n\nTasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.\n\n#Rule 9: No disguised rants, agenda posts, potstirring, disruptive topics\n\nQuestions not asked in good faith - such as a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question, as well as leading questions, or those asked merely to promote an agenda will be removed.\n\nWe are a small, volunteer mod team and there is a limit to our ability to respond to brigading and trolling from Reddit at large.

Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.\n\nThis is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.\n\nAfter 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq).\n\n---\n\n#Important Links\n\n* ##[Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n* ##[How To Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/howtopost)\n\n* Visit our sister subreddit /r/AmItheButtface/ for posts about fiction or relationships, and basically anything that we don't allow here! /r/AmItheCloaca for posts from animals and /r/AmItheGrasshole for all your lawncare conflicts!\n\n* See our *~~Best Of~~* \"Most Controversial\" at /r/AITAFiltered \n\n* Looking for some Regional Assholes? /r/AkoBaYungGago/ /r/BenIkDeEikel /r/BinIchDasArschloch /r/EuSouOBabaca  /r/suisjeletroudeballe  \n\n* See our [resources for those in an unhealthy or abusive relationship](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/resources) and [resources for members of the LGBTQIA+ community that might need help or support](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/resources/lgbtqiaplus)\n\n* https://al-anon.org/ and http://www.teen-anon.com/\n\n* https://smartrecovery.org/\n\n* https://www.childhelp.org/\n\n---\n\n#Voting Guide\n\nIn your top level comment be sure to include one abbreviation for your judgment, i.e.\n\n**YTA** = You're the Asshole; \n\n**YWBTA** = You Would Be the Asshole;\n\n**NTA** = Not the A-hole (and the other person is); \n\n**YWNBTA** = You Would Not be the Asshole  (and the other person would);\n\n**ESH** = Everyone Sucks here;\n \n**NAH** = No A-holes here; \n\n**INFO** = Not Enough Info \n\n---\n\n#**Rules**\n\n##1. Be Civil\n\nAttack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\n\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\n\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n\n##2. Voting Rules\n\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. **DON'T** downvote if you think OP is an asshole. **DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH.** Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don\u2019t engage. \n\nDon't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. **Violations will earn a permanent ban.**\n\n##3. Accept Your Judgment\n\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n\n##4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\n\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for **at least 48 hours**. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n\n##5. No Violence\n\nDon't even *mention* violence.\n\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about **not mentioning.**\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \n\nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. **Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.**\n\n##6. How To Post\n\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\n\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n\n##7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\n\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\n\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who\u2019s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n\n##8. No Shitposts\n\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\n\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\n\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n\n##9. Do Not Ask For Advice\n\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\n\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\n\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n\n##10. Updates and META posts are restricted\n\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\n\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the [update criteria](https://tinyurl.com/zn2kbnnw) for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\n \nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n\n##11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\n\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\n- AITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with \\**anyone** (or not). \n- AITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\n- AITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\n- Reproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\n- Posts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\n- Or [similar conflicts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq/#wiki_rule_11.3A_no_partings.2Frelationship.2Fsex.2Freproductive_autonomy_posts) that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n##12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\n\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\n\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n\n##13. No Revenge Stories\n\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge\u2014this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n\n##14. No Medical Conflicts\n\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n\n##15.

[Nor did it start as one](//pcmasterrace.org/history). This is a [normal subreddit with occasional tongue-in-cheek humor elements](//pcmasterrace.org/community). We are a community where many of its members share similar opinions about the main topics, and sometimes end up having private jokes amongst ourselves.  We are not a community where members feign stupidity when posting and commenting because they find it funny. You can be banned if you conduct yourself like that here.\r\n* Owning a console does not necessarily make you a ['peasant'](//pcmasterrace.org/consolepeasants).\r\n* We created Reddit's most popular [Wiki](/r/pcmasterrace/w/).\r\n* If needed, you can [message the team behind PCMR](//reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/pcmasterrace).\r\n\r\n---\r\n#[Rules](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules)\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth explanation of our rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules).\r\n\r\n* [**Rule #1**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.231) Harassment of others is strictly forbidden. We will not tolerate any kind of incitement to action against anyone, nor will we allow the posting of information that can be used to harm others (celebrities or not).\r\n* [**Rule #2**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.232) We will not allow behavior contrary to [PCMR Etiquette](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/etiquette), e.g. brigading, witch-hunting, asking for upvotes or downvotes, enabling piracy, flamebaiting, clickbaiting, intentional rudeness, text spamming, using all caps or emojis/smileys/emoticons in titles or overusing them in comments, meta-reddit or meta-subreddit drama or complaints.\r\n* [**Rule #3**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.233) Don't link to threads in other subreddits. This includes NP links and archived links. Do not attempt to circumvent this rule by any means.\r\n* [**Rule #4**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.234) Screenshots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, and other site's comments should have the usernames blacked out (including yours). Celebrities are the exception, as long as you respect rule #1.\r\n* [**Rule #5**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.235) No affiliate/referral links or codes.\r\n* [**Rule #6**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.236) The following will be removed at moderator discretion: \r\n - 6.1: Content that is either low quality, unrelated, especially unoriginal, or low-effort (including, but not limited to: simple website/software bugs, steam/product reviews, comedic product/system specs, steam gift messages, screenshots of conversations, internet speed test results, negligible price reductions, items that aren't PC related, even if they are named similarly or resemble it, online petitions and surveys that aren't academic in nature (and have been pre-approved by the mod team).\r\n - 6.2: Pictures of purchase or shipping related notifications and information.\r\n - 6.3: Blatant reposts/fad-chasing.\r\n - 6.4: Reaction content (images/gifs/memes), unless very high-quality/especially original.\r\n - 6.5: [Concern trolling](//goo.gl/TPnnnw).\r\n - 6.6: Feigning idiocy when posting or commenting, or linking to such content.\r\n* [**Rule #7**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.237) Age, nationality, race, gender, ability, sexuality, religion, political affiliation and economic status are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race. Also, linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies, or making distasteful analogies in this regard, is not acceptable in the slightest.\r\n* [**Rule #8**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.238) No begging. No [soft begging](https://goo.gl/4J9rq6). No Implicit or explicit trading. No buying. No Selling. No asking for valuation. No asking how or where to do these either.\r\n* [**Rule #9**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.239) Message the mods first, and wait for permission, if your post/comment is NSFW. Do not mark your post as NSFW or as Spoiler unless it actually is NSFW or a Spoiler.\r\n* [**Rule #10**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.2310) Screenshots of \"peasantry,\" including but not limited to conversations on Reddit, other websites or sms/chat screenshots where ignorance is being spewed and/or ridiculed, must be text posts.\r\n\r\n#Giveaway Rules\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).\r\n\r\n* The Master Race is generous. When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don't mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.\r\n* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).\r\n* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.\r\n* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.\r\n* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).\r\n* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways.

Do not alter headlines; copy and paste. | The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly.  **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on.  Do not use the \u201csuggest title\u201d option for posting as it often does not match the headline.  As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed.  The **only exception** is that, if an article has a title in **all caps**, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.|\n|2. Submit only if \u201cOniony\u201d. | Please consider submitting your article to /r/OffBeat or similar subreddits unless it truly reads like The Onion wrote it. The title and article itself must both be \"Oniony\". This can be highly subjective; you are encouraged to upvote articles that should be here and downvote those that should not.  Moderators can also remove posts at their own discretion under this rule.  [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/done_to_death)|\n|3. Must be a news article. | Submissions must be in the form of a news article.  Videos are only allowed if they are accompanied by a complete text article.  Editorials, blogs, twitter posts, image galleries, tabloid stories, youtube videos, meta posts, static images, articles with fewer than 5 sentences, and so forth will be removed.|\n|4. Use original, reliable sources. | Find the source of your story before you submit it, simply by checking for references or googling the subject to locate the original piece.  Websites that frequently re-host viral news stories or contain misleading information are on [automatic removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval).  Blogs are not reliable sources.|\n|5. Do not repost similar articles. | Check the sub for your story before you submit it; if it\u2019s already here then please vote and comment there instead of posting another version.  Similar stories will be removed and frequent re-posters will lose their posting privileges.  Do not delete and repost your own submissions without approval.|\n|6. No satire articles. | Even if they are technically from a source other than _The Onion_, any article submission written as satire or even true stories written in a satirical manner are not allowed.  Please note that some major news outlets have satirical sections, such as the Borowitz Report on the New Yorker, which are also not allowed.  Meanwhile, AVClub, while owned by The Onion, is not satire and is allowed. If you'd like, you can use a tool like http://realorsatire.com/ to see if your submission is from a known satirical website.|\n|7. No tabloid journalism. | Do not post tabloid news stories, or articles that source from tabloid news outlets (TheSun, Mirror, Dailymail, People, TMZ, etc).|\n|8. No old news. | Articles need to have been written within two weeks of its submission date.|\n|9. English articles only. | Please do not post non-English articles.  Do not use google translate for submission either; rather try to find an English version of the story by a secondary source.|\n|10.

Post title must be a current, unbiased, and coherent question\n- The title is the most important aspect of creating a post. If it's hard for other users to understand what you are asking then it will be hard to get an answer. \n - **Current** - The topic of the post you are creating must be a trending event that has happened recently.\n - **Unbiased** - Don't put your own twist on it to make it come off negative or positive. Try to be as neutral as possible. \n - **Coherent** - Write a complete question that is clear about what you are trying to ask. Don't simply put one word and a question mark. \n - **Format** - **[Include the format listed here.](/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/titles)**\n\n\n#2. Post must include context and resources in the body of the text\n- Context is key when trying to find a proper answer. The more we know about what you are asking, the better we can answer with more information. \n - **Context** - Add some words to your post so there is more to work with than a title. Words such as; what you saw, where you saw it, how often you saw it. \n - **Resources** - You obviously saw it somewhere; link to the thing that made you ask. Or include a screenshot.  \n\n\n#3. No ad nauseam, recently reposted, or retired questions\n- Often times what you are asking has already been answered. Be sure to search the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/search), [Google](https://www.google.com/), and [KnowYourMeme](http://knowyourmeme.com/) before creating a new post.\n - **Ad nauseam** - The topic in question has been discussed extensively, and that those involved in the discussion have grown tired of it.\n - **Recently reposted** - A topic is popular and is posted multiple times within a short period of time.\n - **Retired** - The '[Big List of Retired Questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/index/retired_questions)' is a wiki page created by the mods that lists overly asked questions that have been thoroughly answered. Duplicates of retired questions may be removed.\n\n#4. Top-level comments must begin with \"Answer:\", and be a genuine, unbiased, and coherent answer\n- People are here to find answers to their questions. If top-level comments are riddled with memes or non-answers then no one wins. \n - **Begin with \"Answer:\"** - This helps weed out low-effort, rule-breaking comments, as well as allows the comments to be more organized.\n - **Genuine** - Attempt to answer with words; don't pop in to tell users to search or drop a link without explanation.\n - **Unbiased** - Answer without putting your own twist of bias towards the answer. However, after you leave an unbiased response, you can add your own opinion as long as it's clearly marked, starting with \"Biased:\".\n - **Coherent** - Write in complete sentences that are clear about what you are trying to say.\n\n#5.

That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n> **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n> **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image.

Submissions\n\n* ####Guidelines:\n\n* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology\n\n* [Self posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/wiki/self-post-guide) must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.\n\n* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.\n\n* ####Please do not submit the following:\n\n* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.\n\n* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. \n\n* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).\n\n* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.\n\n* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\n\n* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.\n\n* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.\n\n* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. \n\n##2. Behaviour\n\n* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling, bad-faith abusive comments, and bigotry/hate in any form are not allowed and will be removed and the user will be banned.\n\n##3. Titles\n\n* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:\n\n* adequately describe the content\n\n* adequately describe the content's relation to technology\n\n* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. \n\n##4. Flair\n\n* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).\n\n##5. Reddit-wide rules.\n\n* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). \n\n* **Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). No Self Promotion.**\n\n***\n\n##Miscellanea\n\n* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.\n\n* Want to host an AMA?

Not a question. Not a showerthought. Not a rant. Not a proposal. Not a fact. An opinion. One opinion. A subjective statement about your position on some topic. Please have a clear, self contained opinion as your post title, and use the text field to elaborate and expand on why you think/feel this way.\n\n* Your opinion must be unpopular. Unpopularity is a bit like an onion. It has layers. Be specific as to where you believe your opinion is unpopular.\n\nRule 2: **Do not post low effort/satirical/troll posts.**\n\n* We get it, you all think this sub is garbage and is just for popular opinions, and you want to be funny and post \"going to be downvoted to oblivion here, but I think racism is bad.\" We enjoy the memes, but please keep them off the sub.\n\n* Filter evasion is a banable offense\n\n* If your post is just one sentence it will be removed. Please try and elaborate on your opinion and justify your position.\n\n* Any opinion that is not well thought out, incoherent, internally contradictory or otherwise nonsensical is subject to removal.\n\nRule 3: **Do not post opinions that are heavily posted/have been on the front page recently.**\n\n* Recent reposts are not allowed.\n\n* Opinions that are constantly posted here are not allowed.\n\n* Posts relating to highly popular topics aren't allowed outside of the relevant megathreads. You can find a list of the topics and their respective megathreads in a post on the top of the sub.\n\n* POSTS DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS SUBREDDIT ARE NOT ALLOWED. No, this isn't censoring criticism, they're just overposted. If you have a meta opinion, put it in the megathread.\n\n* We ask that if a post fails to post do not just spam repost it; message mod mail.\n\nRule 4: **Be Civil.**\n\n* This applies for both your behaviour on the sub, and the opinions which you post.\n\n* Obey the sitewide rules and [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette).\n\n* No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or general bigotry.\n\n* Some opinions are so inappropriate/offensive that they'll be removed as hate posts. These posts are usually, but not exclusively, those that target a particular sex, race, sexual orientation, etc, when the user in question is hostile, vulgar or aggressive towards said group.\n\nRule 5: **No Political Posts.**\n\n* Our users have voted for no political posts in this sub, and this rule will not be changed until the majority votes otherwise. \n\n* It's very unlikely your political post is an unpopular opinion. Feel free to use the Politics Megathread pinned to the front page. Our civility rules apply at all times.\n\n\nRule 6.\n**No r/self style posts**\n\n* Please refrain from posting anything that resembles an r/self-style post.\n\n* This is not the subreddit to be sharing personal anecdotes, likes or dislikes. We want unpopular, thought provoking, and unique opinions on your chosen topic.\n\n7.\n**No Banned/Mega-Thread topics**\n\n* Please do not post from (or mention) any of our mega-thread or banned topics such as:\n\n* Race, Religion, LGBTQ, Meta, Politics, Parenting/Family issues.", "subscribers": 4442939, "created_utc": 1329182830.0, "over18": false, "url": "https://reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion", "icon_img": "", "active_users": 638, "weekly_posts": 100}, "2025-01-14T15:50:25.878765"], "popculturechat": [{"name": "popculturechat", "title": "popculturechat", "description": "**Welcome to our community!**\n\nThis is the place to discuss anything and everything pop culture, from movies, memes, and music to celebrity gossip and analytical discussions.\n\nYou can snark OR stan, but keep it civil and don't attack people you don't agree with.\n\nThis is an inclusive community and ALL members should be treated with respect. No bigotry, no bullying, no harassment.\n\n**Keep it cute or keep it mute!**\n\nPlease read the following rules before posting and commenting. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us via modmail. Thanks!\n\n**CIVIL DISCUSSION ONLY**\nThis subreddit is for civil discussion only. While shade, wit & snark are welcome, bullying, harassment, bigotry & personal attacks are not. \n\nDo not attack other users for their fandom. Do not use someone's post history to attack them. Do not bait users. Treat everyone with respect. Attack the argument, not the person. Violations of this rule will result in an immediate ban.\n\nThis is not \"Mean Girls.\" Everyone can sit with us if they are respectful & engaging in good faith.\n\nKeep it cute or keep it mute!\n\n**NO ISMS / PHOBIAS / HATE SPEECH**\nWhile we support marginalized communities' rights to reclaim slurs, we do NOT support bigotry or using bigoted language to denigrate anyone. This includes but is not limited to: racism, sexism, ableism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia & xenophobia.\n\nThis subreddit is an inclusive LGBTQ+, BIPOC woman-dominated space. Bigotry is not welcome here.\n\n**RUMORS & GOSSIP**\nDo not mislead or use poor sourcing. Any unverified rumors should be clearly labeled as such & only cite from respected & reputable sources. Anything else will be removed.\n\nWe provide a weekly tea discussion post where you can discuss unverified gossip. Please keep it in the space we provide for you.\n\n**APPEARANCE & OBJECTIFICATION**\nNo objectification, slut shaming, slurs or derogatory insults on appearance and/or weight. \n\nA lot of celebrities have had work done, and many may alter their online appearances with photoshop and other filters. \n\nIt\u2019s fine (and healthy!) to discuss these things in a world obsessed with beauty standards but we don\u2019t need to be overly negative and tear someone down to do that. \n\nIf someone can't change their appearance within minutes, don't make negative comments. Be kind!\n\n**CELEBRITY CHILDREN**\nSelf-explanatory. Immediate bans for any negative comments directed to or about anyone under the age of 18. \n\nPhotos of celebrity children without their parents (yes this includes bday posts or creepy fan sites for celeb children) will be removed & the post authors will be suspended pending review.\n\nWe do allow photos that have been posted publicly by the parents on social media. However, be very respectful & don't make an entire post dedicated just to the child.\n\n**SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS**\nIt\u2019s fine to share social media posts but we require the names to be blocked out unless it\u2019s a verified account, meme, a celebrity or the name has appeared in the news (public). Posts that violate this rule will be removed until the information is hidden.\n\n**USE THE SPOILER FLAIR**\nSince this is a pop culture sub we will talk about new releases & spoilers. However, we require all spoilers to use the spoiler flair. Comments with spoilers not in a flaired spoiler post must be covered. No spoilers in the title.\n\n**NO META DISCUSSION**\nNo meta discussion allowed!\n\nWe will have regular meta & off-topic posts where members of the sub can talk about everything under the sun that is not celeb-related. Every other time? Stay on topic & keep it cute. \n\nIf you have suggestions or wish to vent you can always use modmail or discuss it in the areas we provide for meta chat. Repeatedly ignoring this rule will result in a ban. \n\nIf you decide to leave the sub, you don\u2019t need to make a post to say goodbye.\n\n**NO LOW EFFORT POSTS**\nNo low effort/low quality posts or post titles. You must put in an effort! \n\nText posts: Descriptions are required! Share information expounding upon your title. \n\nLinks: Titles should have a description of what you're sharing. Otherwise leave a comment with context.\n\nPhotos: You must leave a comment providing context if it isn't apparent in the title. \n \n**This is to encourage discussion and because not everyone knows every pop culture reference or celebrity.**\n\n**NO REPOSTS**\nTo keep the conversations fresh & interesting, similar posts may be removed. All reposts of megathread questions/topics or pinned content will be removed. \n\nReposts are defined as posting the same meme, content, question, news article, etc. with similar titles, discussion questions, or the like. Do not rehash the same topic by posting something that could be a comment in a current thread.\n\nIf there's already a current post for the topic, you can provide updates with images/links in the comments.\n\n**HEALTH ANALYSIS & TRIGGERS**\nNo overly invasive diagnoses of strangers or suggestive commentary about their physical or mental health, including addiction. No armchair diagnosing. Be extremely mindful of the language you use. \n\nRespect boundaries & respect that your experiences are not everyone\u2019s. Most importantly respect your own energy and know when to step back.\n\nFor posts with triggering content, a brief description is required in the first line of the text post (e.g. TW: Reason). Use the trigger warning post flair.\n\n**DEADNAMING & PRONOUNS**\nRespect this always, regardless of the context or if referring to someone pre-transition. If you are unsure they/them will suffice. Any & all wilful disrespect with this rule is a ban worthy offense. No excuses.\n\n**NO SPAM OR SELF-PROMOTION**\nNo links to your own social media, companies, blogs, brands, unverified news sources, etc. \n\nSelf created content, such as fan-art/fan-edits, are allowed & encouraged! There are exceptions if a video or article is a deep dive or informational. In these cases, we ask for context to open discussion on said post. Moderator discretion applies.\n\n**POLITICAL & SOCIETAL DEBATE**\nNo overly politcal posts or comments. While we do allow discussions around politics, this isn't a political sub. If it doesn't fit in pop culture, it doesn't belong here.\n\nThere will be times where societal discussions happen. Healthy discussion around societal topics  are fine as long as you engage in good faith.\n\nBe respectful to others who do not share your viewpoint. If someone is purposely trolling, do not engage! Report any rule violations to the mods via the report button or modmail.\n\n**AGREE TO DISAGREE & MOVE ON**\nWhile civil discussion is encouraged, arguing for the sake of arguing & flame wars is not. No one needs to have the last word. Know when to agree to disagree & move on.\n\nRespect boundaries. If someone says they are done discussing things with you, do not continue to engage.

It's okay to disagree with someone, but using ad hominem attacks instead of having an actual discussion is not acceptable.|\n|1.2 Discrimination|Attacks based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, nationality, ancestry, or religion are prohibited. Civil discussion is permitted, but using these traits as weapons is not allowed.|\n|1.3 Witch-Hunting & Calls to Action|It is strictly prohibited to engage in witch-hunting activities on this subreddit, and any sort of promotion or request for raiding servers is not allowed. Any attempts to rally the community for a particular purpose, such as voting for a poll, promoting a boycott, or advertising a petition, will be removed as it is considered a \"call to action\".|\n|2.1 Low-effort Submissions|Moderators may remove content that is deemed as low-effort. This includes but is not limited to **quality, memes, rants, screenshots lacking info/context, vague titles, & posts irrelevant to Discord**. *[Full description](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/wiki/rules/#wiki_2.1_low-effort_submissions)*|\n|2.2 Safe For Work Content Only|Excessively violent or sexual content, including but not limited to death threats, explicit content, gore, or content that sexualizes or harasses other users is not allowed. However, discussing NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content is allowed as long as it is tagged appropriately and is relevant to the discussion.|\n|2.3 Client Modifications|Client modifications such as Better Discord and BeautifulDiscord are not supported and are considered a violation of Discord's Terms of Service. Therefore, we do not discuss these matters on the subreddit. Third-party add-ons like these are not safe to use. Installing any third-party software that modifies the Discord client can create vulnerabilities that may expose you to malicious code or result in the loss of your account. It is highly recommended to avoid using such software to ensure the security of your Discord account.|\n|3.1 Recently Posted Topics|Reposted topics are not allowed. Threads that focus on topics that have been discussed at high frequency, cover information from the same angle, or are covered in our FAQ pages may be removed. Please use the Reddit search bar, check /new, or the front page as this is a topic that has been largely posted/discussed recently.|\n|3.2 Advertising/Self-Promotion|No advertising/self-promoting servers, selling/buying accounts, trading, or nitro begging. Server self-promotion will result in an immediate perm ban. Advertising personal bots/projects is allowed if it does not make up a notable portion of your account history.|\n|3.3 Code Giveaways|We do not allow giveaways on this subreddit as they create spam and we cannot verify that all users receive their prizes (when required to enter). If you want to give away your code(s), please use this [post](https://redd.it/18s8fwf).|\n|3.4 Third-Party Bot Support|If you are having trouble with a third-party bot, we recommend you contact their support team. Try searching the bots name on Google as most bots have a support website or server. Some of the more popular ones are [Dyno](https://dyno.gg/discord), [Mee6](https://discord.gg/mee6), [YAGPDB](https://discord.gg/4udtcA5), & [Carl-bot](https://discord.gg/S2ZkBTnd8X)|\n|4.1 Account Support|This subreddit is not the appropriate place to post account-related issues/requests/complaints. If you are having an issue with Discord's product or need to contact them for any reason, please [search their support knowledge base](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us) for answers or send a ticket to Discord\u2019s [support team](https://dis.gd/contact). If you've already sent a ticket, please be patient and wait for an answer. The support team often has a slow response time due to the number of open tickets.|\n|4.2 User Report|This sub is for talking about Discord as a product, service, or brand in ways that don't break Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). If you believe a user has violated ToS, [please report them](https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord).|\n|4.3 Bug Reporting or Feature Requests|Technical questions and issues other users may be able to assist with are allowed, but bug reports should be shared directly with Discord. To learn how to report them via the [Discord Help Center](https://dis.gd/bugreport), read [this blog post](https://dis.gd/bugs) for instructions! While feature requests and feedback inspire awesome discussions on the subreddit, we encourage sharing them with Discord directly via a [Discord Feedback](https://dis.gd/feedback) submission. Submitting there guarantees higher visibility from the people who can implement the suggestions.|\n|5. Reddit rules|The Reddit content policy and terms of service must be followed at all times. Some of our other subreddit rules overlap with the site-wide rules, but such rules provide more information specific to r/discordapp to help you understand what kind of content is allowed.

Any negative comments regarding someone's race, creed, nationality or sexual identity will result in a permaban.\n\n> No trolling or baiting.\n\n> No calls for violence against any groups or individuals.\n\n> Any account less than 90 days old may be permanently banned on the first infraction of this rule.\n\n##  **Rule #1: No spam, porn, or facilitating piracy**\n\n> [**Please see our full rules on self-promotion here.**](/r/pcgaming/wiki/selfpromotion)\n\n> [**Please see our full rules on piracy here.**](/r/pcgaming/wiki/piracy)\n\n## **Rule #2:  No advertisements**\n\n> Ads include, but are not limited to, chat/game server & community recruitment (i.e. [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-pcgaming-482363499977375785), TeamSpeak), contextless website or subreddit links, and listings on eBay or other sales platforms.\n\n> No affiliate or referral links: This includes Amazon, GMG tap links, Star Citizen, etc.\n\n> Developers must be [verified](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/wiki/developers) before posting about their projects and, once they are, are not bound by rule #2.\n\n##  **Rule #3: No memes, PCMR language, or low-effort posts/comments**\n\n> This includes contextless images/screenshots/GIFs as well as anti-platform or PCMR language such as \"master race\" and calling people peasants.  \n\n> Low effort posts/comments and submissions not attempting to create discussion are prohibited.\n\n##  **Rule #4: No tech support or game help questions**\n\n> Tech support questions can be posted in our stickied tech support thread or, if you need immediate assistance, in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-pcgaming-482363499977375785).\n\n> General game related discussion is allowed, but game-specific help requests (how to defeat a certain boss or level, what loadout is best for my character, etc) and basic questions (is a game co-op, does this game have controller support, etc) aren't. Those questions would be more appropriate for our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-pcgaming-482363499977375785) or the game's subreddit if it exists.\n\n##  **Rule #5:  No questions about building/buying computers, hardware, peripherals, furniture, etc**\n\n> This includes \"Can my PC run this?\" type questions, links showing off your computer build, or asking questions about builds.\n\n> Use [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-pcgaming-482363499977375785) for all PC building questions. You can also try /r/buildapc, /r/buildapcforme, /r/SuggestALaptop, /r/headphones, /r/monitors, /r/mechanicalkeyboards, and /r/mousereview for more specific questions.\n\n##  **Rule #6: No game suggestions, friend requests, surveys, or begging.**\n\n> Game suggestion requests and all their variations belong in the weekly game suggestion thread that runs from Fri - Sun. Alternatively, we also have a [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-pcgaming-482363499977375785) channel where you can ask for game suggestions.\n\n> This includes group/clan recruitment. Our Discord has channels for finding people to play with.\n\n> We no longer allow surveys. You can try /r/samplesize.\n\n> Please don\u2019t make requests for spare game keys or PC parts. GoFundMe and other fundraising posts are also prohibited.\n\n##  **Rule #7: No Let's Plays, streams, highlight reels/montages, random videos or shorts**\n\n> In addition to this, Youtube links posted by new accounts are filtered due to channel spamming.\n\n##  **Rule #8: No off-topic posts/comments**\n\n> Keep posts and comments related to PC gaming and the topic being discussed.\n\n## **Rule #9: Use the original source, no editorialized titles, no duplicates**\n\n> Submissions must use the original source when available. Sources that are pay-walled, not in english, and corporate earning calls are exempted from this rule.\n\n> Don't editorialize your titles. In the case of clickbait, or content lacking context, you may **lightly** edit the title.

Treat other users the way you want to be treated. Avoid straw-manning and bad-faith interpretations. Avoid presenting misinformation as factual.\n\n**2: No Trashposts**  \nPosts deemed to be entirely without value or effort may be removed if they have not generated interesting discussions before their discovery. Users are encouraged to report posts they feel are of significantly low effort. Specifically mentioning that \u201cIs chat GPT down posts?\u201d will be removed. The stickied FAQ deals with that.\n\n**3: Self Advertising**  \nPosts must be directly related to ChatGPT or the topic of LLMs. They may not be solely focused on advertising a single other LLM service. Find or establish a relative subreddit for that service.\n\n**4: Political Discussion**  \nHaving ChatGPT create political content is completely fine. Discussion of the politics around AI and LLMs is allowed. This is not the place to discuss the merits of Trump's foreign policy or Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop.\n\n**5: No NSFW Content**  \nThis is a SFW sub. Any posts violating this rule will be removed, and repeated offenses may result in a ban.\n\n**6: AI Art**\n\n- Quality over Quantity: AI art submissions are allowed only if they showcase something unique, unusual, or particularly interesting. Generic memes, low-effort images, or art intended solely for karma farming will be removed.\n\n- Encourage Tech Discussion: Posts that include insights, techniques, or thought-provoking commentary about the AI process or technology behind the art are highly encouraged.\n\n- Mod Discretion: Mods reserve the right to remove posts that do not meet the above criteria.\n\n___\n**[Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/r-chatgpt-1050422060352024636)**\n\n**[Join us on Telegram](https://t.me/r_ChatGPT)**", "subscribers": 8691941, "created_utc": 1669925967.0, "over18": false, "url": "https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPT", "icon_img": "", "active_users": 931, "weekly_posts": 100}, "2025-01-14T15:50:55.417784"], "GlobalOffensive": [{"name": "GlobalOffensive", "title": "Counter-Strike", "description": "## [Submit a banner!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwue21P_yrIOHga5gf6ArdRCPTaZXAiCkk3y2LeH75pwEBSg/viewform)\n\n[*New?

No Reposts**\nMake sure you aren't submitting a post that has already been submitted. It's a good idea to browse our top 100 posts of all time to avoid making this mistake and to familiarize yourself with the subreddit. Frequent reposting may result in a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n**2. No Advertising**\nWhile you are allowed to post your own content on this subreddit (which MUST use the flair \"OC\"), do not post videos with the title advertising your TikTok page. This includes phrases such as \"follow me, like my TikTok, etc.\" No linking your TikTok page in comments unless it is under your own video. This will result in your post/comment being immediately deleted. Blatant advertisement trying to get views or followers for yourself/others will result in a permanent ban.\n\n**3. Flair Posts Correctly**\nAll posts must be marked and flaired correctly. This makes it easier for users to sort by flair to see the content they are looking for. If a moderator feels your post is not flaired correctly, the flair may be changed or the post may be removed.\n\n**4. All Original Content MUST be Flaired as Such**\nAlong with rule 3, all original content posted MUST use the \u201cOC\u201d flair. We would like our users to know if you created the video you posted. This also helps prevent self advertisement and spam. Users not following this rule should be reported immediately and will receive a one month ban.\n\n**5. Posts Must Be From TikTok**\nAll posts must be directly from TikTok. This means that you can clearly see the original creator's username as well as the TikTok logo in the corner of the video. Any video with the original poster's username cut out will not be considered a TikTok. Violation of this rule may result in a temporary ban.\n\n**6. No Posting of Personal Information**\nDo not post any personal information. This includes real names, phone numbers, addresses, etc. This may result in a permanent ban.\n\n**7. Don't Witch-hunt**\nDo not call for the heads of anyone displayed in anything posted here. This will result in an immediate and permanent ban.\n\n**8. No Being Deliberately Rude, Vulgar, or Offensive to Others in Comments**\nDo not go out of your way to put down other members of the community in the comment section of a post. This may result in a permanent ban. If you see someone breaking this rule, simply report them and move on. No need to respond and get yourself banned as well.\n\n**9. Hate Speech**\nThere will be zero tolerance for explicit racism, homophobia/transphobia, or sexism/misogyny. Engaging in any sort of hate speech will result in the post or comment being removed and you will receive a permanent ban.\n\n**10. No Bad-Faith Posts Featuring Anyone Who is Mentally Ill or Disabled**\nNo content is allowed that focuses on people who are mentally ill or disabled. This will result in an immediate and permanent ban.\n\n**11. No Compilations/YouTube Video Re-uploads**\nThis is not a place to post compilations. Posting compilations may result in a permanent ban.\n\nUploading videos that are clearly YouTube videos (SNL skits, Video game highlights, etc) are not allowed. Even if you found it on TikTok, do not post ripped unedited YouTube video-TikToks here. This may result in a temporary ban.\n\n**12. Don't Complain About the Subreddit Name**\nThe subreddit evolved long ago last it's roots of \"only cringe-worthy\" content. There have been two community polls where over 85% of users agreed to include all content. It's come to the point where users who say \"This isn't cringe\" or anything of that sort, may receive a temporary ban. We have made this clear enough with a pinned comment on every single post.\n\n**13. All Political Posts MUST be Flaired as Such**\nAll political posts must be flaired as \"politics.\" Failure to do so will result in a temporary ban.\n\n**14. No spamming/irrelevant gif replies**\nBecause we are apart of reddit's POWERUPS program, users are able to reply to posts/comments with gifs. Anyone seen spamming or posting gifs completely irrelevant to the post or comment in question will receive a temporary ban.", "subscribers": 4661176, "created_utc": 1533622973.0, "over18": false, "url": "https://reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe", "icon_img": "", "active_users": 1039, "weekly_posts": 100}, "2025-01-14T15:51:08.944966"], "PiratedGames": [{"name": "PiratedGames", "title": "r/PiratedGames - Talk about pirated games and cracks!", "description": "Welcome to the PiratedGames subreddit, talk about pirated games and new cracks!\n\n#[](#bigspecialbutton) **[Discord](https://discord.gg/dZWwhUy)**\n\nPlease read the rules before posting!\n\n# [**READ THE STICKIED MEGATHREAD!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/wiki/megathread//)\n\n**RULES:**\n#1.

Don\u2019t violate Reddit's Content Policy**\n1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.\n\n\n###**II. Don't be a cunt**\n\n1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.\n\n\n###**III. Shitposts \ud83d\ude03 God awful posts \ud83d\ude21**\n\n1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. \n\n\n###**IV. Mod discretion**\n\n1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. \u00a722SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible\n\n\n###**V. -**\n\n1. -\n\n\n###**VI. No excessive spamming**\n\n1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.\n\n\n###**VII. Number 7**\n\n1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don\u2019t be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole \u201cdon\u2019t be a cunt\u201d thing, just don\u2019t\n\n\n###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**\n\n1. im at work \ud83d\ude21what if my boss sees boobies on my screen \ud83e\udd2c. \"idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not\" then just mark it anyways.\n\n\n###**X.

For example, \"A cool guide about identifying poison ivy\", \"A cool guide showing how to clean your house\", or \"A cool guide for painting your living room\".\n\n**Defining a Guide**\n\nGuides are reference materials, how-tos, and/or comparison tables.  It takes both content and layout to make something a guide. The layout or structure of a guide must be that so, when someone is trying to find/reference information from the guide, they can do so logically or simply. If someone has to visually bop around your guide to find what they are looking for, the guide does not pass the layout test. On top of that not all guides are created equal, many technically qualify as guides, but lack substance. Guides are typically laid out in a grid configuration of some sort or sectioned into multiple tables by a category or step of a process. Flow charts and step-by-step guides are considered guides, so are visual references that line up different types of something next to one another other.\n\n**Defining An Infographic**\n\nAn infographic is more educational in layout and content, finding something specific on an infographic is not as easy because it is designed to inform through more narrative structures. If your guide is more of a visual essay than a structured table or list, then chances are that is an infographic. Sometimes infographics can masquerade as how-to guides. \n\n**Remembering That Sometimes It's Grey**\nThese are the considerations the mod team use when they feel it is appropriate to remove posts. If you have questions message us, if you think a post is not a good one downvote it.\n\n***Subreddit Rules***\n\n**1. Please only post direct links to images of type .png, .jpg, and .jpeg**\n\n**2. Infographics will be removed.**\n\n**3. Nonserious/Comedy Guides Will Be Removed (better suited for /r/shittycoolguides)**\n\n**4. Guides must use either Reddit or Imgur as an image host**\n\n**5. Guides depicting harmful, dangerous, or destructive content will be removed. This includes guides describing the creation of dangerous items/materials and/or guides that are designed with the purpose to harm or hurt others do not fit the culture of this sub and will be removed.** \n\nIf you know the source of your guide, post it in the comments so people can know the true heros!\n\nMany of you might have whole folders of guides, but they are all on similar topics. Please help keep the sub diverse by not saturating the sub with one topic. If you do we may remove some of your posts in the interest of keeping a wide array of topics.\n\n***Lastly, always check the comments for guides. Moderators are not experts in everything so we do not always moderate for accuracy, though there are often one or two people wearing their smarty pants in the comments.***", "subscribers": 5767592, "created_utc": 1395333999.0, "over18": false, "url": "https://reddit.com/r/coolguides", "icon_img": "", "active_users": 122, "weekly_posts": 98}, "2025-01-14T15:51:31.374526"], "AskMen": [{"name": "AskMen", "title": "AskMen", "description": "> ###Community Rules:\n\n\n\n> **DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE.**\n\n> **Unsure if the rules apply to you for your post/comment? [Click here.](https://i.imgur.com/m8mbW4i.gif)**\n>\n>  * [](#icon-information) [Message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskMen) with any questions/comments.  This includes external sites looking to farm responses for content. NO SURVEYS.\n\n>  * [](#icon-information) **Read the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/wiki/index) wiki and do a search before asking a question.**\n\n>  * [](#icon-information) **We do not allow questions/comments from throwaways or accounts with low karma (< 5 for comments, < 10 for posts).** Participate elsewhere on Reddit to gain experience and karma before trying to post here.\n\n>  * [](#icon-information) **Be respectful.** Anyone is allowed to ask and answer questions. Do not insult or troll people, including in PMs.\n\n>  * [](#icon-information) **Don't comment/post self-deprecating content looking for attention.**  First warning is a temp ban, second warning is a permaban.  If you want to be a sad sack and complain about your life, go to /r/rant or /r/ForeverAlone \n\n\n> ###Post Guidelines:\n\n> 1. [](#icon-cross) **Don't be an asshole / be respectful to others.**\n\n>   Don't be an asshole.  Pretty simple.  This does not mean you can report people for saying mean things to you and hurting your feefees.  We're not a safe space here, if you make a comment or an argument, be prepared to defend it if people call you out on your shit.  But don't resort to name calling or telling people to kill themselves. Blatant racism, sexism etc is punishable with a permanent ban.  Posting AI generated comments will results in a ban.\n\n> 2. [](#icon-information) **The title of your post must contain an actual, concise question. No clickbait titles.**\n\n>   The title of your post must contain an actual question. Keep your question concise, and don't make a clickbait title like \"What do you think of this?\". Any question that can be answered with \u201cSome do, some don\u2019t. Men are not all the same\u201d falls under this rule.\n\n> 3. [](#icon-information) **Read the Frequently Asked Questions wiki and do a search before asking a question.**\n\n>   We remove frequently asked questions. [you can find them here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/wiki/index). Apart from these, we also remove questions that we deem frequently asked enough to warrant removal but have not yet been added to the FAQ.\n\n> 4. [](#icon-cross) **Do not post asking about dating advice, or a person or group's actions, behavior, or thinking.**\n\n>   Do not make posts trying to figure out a specific person's actions, behavior, or thinking.\n\n>   NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HE/SHE IS THINKING. ASK THEM! Don't ask men when you really want to ask A man.\n\n>   *This is not a place to seek dating or relationship advice*. Go to /r/advice or /r/relationship_advice.\n\n>   This also goes for wanting to suss out men or women's behavior as an entire gender. We don't want people speculating into the actions and behaviors of people they arent.\n\n> 5. [](#icon-cross) **YES/NO/\"Does anyone else\" questions will be removed at our discretion.**\n\n>   Taken from the mod post:\n\n>   If we feel like your question can be answered with a \"yes\" or a \"no\", asks \"does anyone else do/feel this way\", or asks \"is X behavior normal\", we will remove it. This also includes 'A or B?' or \"What would you rather?\" type questions\n\n>   This is pretty straightforward. Please exercise some common sense here.\n\n> 6. [](#icon-cross) **Do not make posts looking for affirmation of your appearance, personality or body features.**\n\n>   Do not make posts looking for affirmation of your appearance, body features, personality traits or life situation. Do not make posts asking about what you look like or what you should wear or what makeup men like. Nobody gives a shit. Go make an instagram post.\n\n> 7. [](#icon-cross) **Do not post negative/forever alone rants.**\n\n>   Do not post negative/forever alone rants. Visit /r/ForeverAlone or /r/rant if you want to complain.\n\n> 8. [](#icon-cross) **Don't comment/post self-deprecating content looking to get karma or attention.**\n\n>   Don't comment/post self-deprecating content looking to get karma or attention. Example: if someone asks what your favorite thing about your girlfriend is and you reply with \"lol that she actually existed lol\" or \"she's my hand lol-ercopter\", we're going to issue a temp ban to you for the first offense and a permaban the next time. Keep your replies on-topic for people asking questions.\n\n> 9. [](#icon-cross) **No questions about gifts or presents.**\n\n>   Seriously, no gift threads. If you are going to ask \"what should I get\"/\"what would be a good gift for\" someone, then go to /r/gifts right now and post your question there because we will not take this shit. This also includes asking for other ways to celebrate/thank/show appreciation to someone.\n\n> 10. [](#icon-cross) **No agenda posting, and no brigading/complaining about other subs.**\n\n>   Don't post a question that is obviously geared towards creating an echo chamber where you can either a) create a circlejerk about how everyone agrees with you or b) get into fights with everyone because you're right and everyone else is a shitlord/plebian/whatever. If you want to get into stupid slapfights with people, then take it somewhere else.\n\n>   Do not link to other subreddits with the intention to draw attention to a certain post or comment. Only archived reddit post links will be approved.\n\n> 11. [](#icon-cross) **Medical advice is not allowed here.**\n\n>   Medical advice is not allowed here. We recommend talking to a medical professional instead of the Internet.\n\n> 12. [](#icon-cross) **We do not allow surveys or promotional content.**\n\n>   Message the moderators with any questions/comments. This includes external sites looking to farm responses for content. We don't currently allow surveys or promotional content.\n\n> 13. [](#icon-cross) **Overly political questions will be removed.**\n\n>   Overly political questions will be removed. There are subs like /r/politics, r/PoliticalDebate, and /r/PoliticalDiscussion if you want to debate political ideas or candidates.\n\n> 14. [](#icon-cross) **Questions overly sexual in nature will be removed.**\n\n>   \"How to sex/sexiest sex you\u2019ve ever sexed/when-where-what sex do you like/ why is sex thing sexy?\u201d and questions of that nature will be removed at our discretion.\n\n>   There are many subs dedicated to these types of questions, please take it there as we\u2019re sick of them: r/sex r/AskRedditAfterDark r/sexoverthirty\n\n> Sometimes automod fucks up - if you think it did, you can message us, but if you roll up to the modmail with a fucking attitude, we're not going to indulge you.
